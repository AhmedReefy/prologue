## Mesh deformation
As far as I've learned, it's the process of mesh deformation / reconstruction into something else. For example ocean waves, through perlin noise algorithm.

## Voxel programming
Voxel, which stands volumetric element similar to what pixel is (picture element), is a programming around the block of voxels.

## Noise generation algorithms / Procedural generation
So far I only know one. Which is perlin noise. But I think, when it comes to procedural generation, it's not necessarily a purely mathematical application, but a combination of many other things.

## Shader programming
A shader is a type of computer program that was originally used for shading (the production of appropriate levels of light, darkness, and color within an image) but which now performs a variety of specialized functions in various fields of computer graphics special effects or does video post-processing unrelated to shading, or even functions unrelated to graphics at all.
